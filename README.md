# StratoStruct Backend Server

Welcome to the StratoStruct backend server repository! StratoStruct is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, designed to provide a platform for managing and analysing structural data. This README provides an overview of the backend server component.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting structural data.
- Integration with MongoDB database for persistent storage of structural data.
- Real-time updates using WebSocket technology for instant data synchronization.
- Error handling and logging for better application stability.
- Custom middleware for authentication and authorization checks.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the backend server, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (running locally or a remote connection)

## Getting Started

To get the backend server up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/HOOLAHAN/stratostruct_server
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd stratostruct-backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Provide the necessary environment variables such as `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:{PORT}`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure for better organization and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key directories and files:

- `controllers/`: Request handlers for various API routes.
- `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions for authentication, error handling, etc.
- `models/`: MongoDB data models and schema definitions.
- `routes/`: Route definitions for different API endpoints.
- `server.js` entry point for the application, sets up the server and middleware.
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies.
